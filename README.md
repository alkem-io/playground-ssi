# Introduction
This file has been created in order to give insights in the smart contracts field assignment. 

# Definition of roles
### **The Client**
The client is the party that offers the smart contract, further named as Client. The Client wants a problem solved and is looking for people solving that problem. The Client can put in a description of the problem, what kind of solution they are expecting, and the amount of money/tokens they are willing to pay.

### **The Deliverers**
The deliverers are the people that will accept the smart contracts offered by the Client, further named as Deliverers. These people are looking for jobs and tasks on the platform.

### **Identities Custodian**
The identities custodian is a role that controls the contract, further named as Custodian. The Custodian will be a trusted third party who will host the smart contract, most likely Odyssey. The Custodian wil be able to access and moderate both the Client's side, as well as the Deliverers' side.

# The use case
In this use case the Custodian will have set up the smart contract on their platform, the Client will set up a listing for a certain price in order to solve a certain problem, which can be described.

The Deliverers can accept the smart contract and post their solution in the smart contract. After the Client accepts the solution to the smart contract, the Deliverers will receive their payment via a signal amount that will initiate a transfer via for example another smart contract.

The diagram below depicts the same interaction flow, but this diagram has a lot more detail in it.

# What the smart contract is supposed to do:
- [x] Client initiates contract & uploads proposal.
- [x] Deliverer connects to smart contract & agrees on the project.
- [x] Deliverer uploads work & confirms delivery.
- [x] Client confirms the delivered work.
- [x] Either client or deliverer transfers the smart contract.
- [x] Both client and deliverer can abandon the smart contract, but only if both agree.

# What other tasks will have to be completed:
- [x] Have a working smart contract contract
- [x] Have a separate working interface for the Client and the Deliverer.
- [ ] Be able to sign a transaction with a Self Sovereign Identity.

## Smart Contract in Solidity
- [x] SolutionsProposed: Client can set and send a proposal to the smart contract.
- [x] ProposalDisplayed: Deliverers can fetch and display the Client's proposal.
- [x] ProposalReplied: Deliverers can accept or deny the proposal.
- [x] ProjectAgreed: Deliverers can confirm delivery of work.
- [x] Workconfirmed: Client can confirm satisfaction of delivery
- [x] ContractTransferred: Deliverers and clients can transfer the funds one the Client and the Deliverers have both confirmed delivery and satisfaction.

## Self Sovereign Identities
- [ ] Client and Deliverers are able to use the interface using SSI.
- [ ] Client and Deliverers are able to sign transactions with their SSI.

## Client en Deliverers user interface
The smart contract is accessible for both the Client and the Deliverers separately. In order to make this possible, 7 files were created. Three general files, two specifically for the Client and two specifically for the Deliverers.

General files:
* styles.css
* package-lock.json
* package.json

For the Client:
* index-onlyClient.html
* script-onlyClient.js

For the Deliverers:
* index-onlyDeliverer.html
* script-onlyDeliverer.js

### **styles.css**
.css stands for Cascading Style Sheet. .css files can control the layout of multiple web pages all at once.

### **package-lock.json**
This file is automatically generated and stores the exact, versioned dependency tree of projects where npm modifies either the node_modules tree or package.json.

### **package.json**
This file is automatically generated as well and exists at the root of a JavaScript/Node project. This file holds metadata relevant to the projects.

### **index-onlyClient/Deliverer.html**
.html files are files that are created in order to format the structure of a webpage.

### **script-onlyClients/Deliverer.js**
A JavaScript to communicate between the smart contract (solidity) and the .html file.

### **Necessary functions of the user interface for the Client's side:**
- [ ] Client can access this portal using their self sovereign identity (or their web2 account).
- [x] Client can add a description of the problem to its proposal.
- [x] Client can send the proposal to the smart contract.
- [x] Client can send a signal amount to the smart contract.
- [x] Client can cancel the contract if the Deliverers agree as well.
- [x] Client can confirm the delivered work.
- [x] Client can transfer the smart contract.

### **Necessary functions of the user interface for the Deliverer's side:**
- [ ] Deliverers can access this portal using their self sovereign identity (or their web2 account).
- [x] Deliverers can fetch the Client's proposal.
- [x] Deliverers can accept or deny this proposal.
- [x] Deliverers can send this reply (accept/deny) to the contract.
- [x] Deliverers can cancel the contract if the Client agrees as well.
- [x] Deliverers can confirm delivery of the project.
- [x] Deliverers can transfer the smart contract.
